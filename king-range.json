King Peak, the highest point at 4,088 feet, is only 3-miles from the ocean. The King Range NCA encompasses 68,000 acres along 35 miles of California's dramatic north coast. Here, the landscape was too rugged for highway building, forcing State Highway 1 inland. This remote region of mountains and seascapes is known as California's Lost Coast and is accessible only by a few back roads. It is the Nation's first NCA, designated in 1970. The King Range NCA's Douglas fir-covered peaks attract hikers, hunters, and campers, while the coast beckons to surfers, anglers, beachcombers, and many others. World-class mountain bike trails, and 42,585 acres of coastal wilderness are two of the highlights of this incredibly unique area. </p>\n<p>Visitors planning to camp overnight anywhere in the King Range Wilderness <strong>must obtain a Wilderness Permit </strong>and will be asked to provide a tentative itinerary; including number of days in the wilderness, entrance trailhead, exit trailhead, and backcountry camp zones. </p>\n<p>To assist in planning an overnight trip into the King Range Wilderness, take time to review the Trip Planning Guide, Tide Safety Guide, Map & Guide and Trail/Road Conditions documents under \"Plan Your Visit\" section of the BLM King Range website:  https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/california/king-range-national-conservation-area.  </p>\n<p>The King Range Wilderness is home to the Lost Coast Trail, a backcountry coastal trail that travels along the beach and coastal bluffs.  It's imperative that visitors plan this trip carefully, using the above resources to find important safety information. </p>\n<p>Are you an organized group? A school group? A Boy or Girl Scout Troop? A Meetup group? A hiking organization? A commercial outfitter?  A shuttle driver? All organized and commercial groups accessing the King Range Wilderness must obtain a Special Recreation Permit along with a Wilderness Permit from the King Range Project Office. Wilderness permits obtained from Recreation.gov alone are not sufficient for organized and commercial groups.  Click <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/permits-and-passes/lotteries-and-permit-systems/california/kingrange\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for more information and/or to request a Special Recreation Permit.  </p>\n<p>For more information or help planning your itinerary, call the King Range Project Office at (707) 986-5400.</p>",

It is up to you to responsibly manage your waste.</p>\n\t<p>Steep mountains make it impossible to find a responsible place to dispose of human waste, except towards the ocean.</p>\n\t<p>Bury human waste on the beach to avoid polluting drinking water sources and keep camp areas clean.</p>\n\t<p>Dig a 6-8” inch hole in wet sand in the intertidal zone. Go as close to the ocean as safely possible. Completely cover your deposit to maximize decomposition and to prevent unsightly encounters by other visitors. The ocean will breakdown the waste upon the next high tide.</p>\n\t<p>Although exposed, other hikers will give you your space if they see you crouching from a distance. The natural rise and fall of the sand will provide privacy from other hikers.</p>\n\t<p>Please remember to pack out toilet paper and feminine hygiene products.</p>\n\t<p>When you are on upland trails, go at least 70 steps from campsites, trails, and water.</p>\n\t<p>Enjoy your visit and thank you for ensuring we keep this pristine area clean.</p>\n\t<p>Video produced by the King Range National Conservation Area.</p>",
